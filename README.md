Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tadhg Coffey, a versatile Frontend Developer based in San Francisco. I spent the past 8 years at Rocket Lawyer on the Acuisition Team, building, maintaining and updating https://www.rocketlawyer.com.

I have a background in architecture, design and product management; and thrive in positions that are technical, creative and encourage cross-team collaboration.

I love solving puzzles while always keeping the big picture in mind. I have an eye for design and years of product management experience, keeping a team of designers, engineers and consultants on task.

I appreciate precision, detail, creativity and perseverance; and I take great pleasure in pixel-perfect user interfaces, intuitive user experiences and well-crafted code. I seek out challenges and strive to learn and expand.
